# UI/UX Master Plan v1.0

## ⭐ PHASE 1 — SECTION 1

The Core Philosophy of Jyoti.app UI/UX

(Identity, Experience, Emotion, Brand Vibration)



🌙 1.1 The Emotional Goal

Jyoti.app is not an app, it is a spiritual experience.

The UI/UX goal is:

⭐ "Make every user feel they have entered a sacred cosmic chamber where AI, astrology, and divine energy blend into one."

The user should feel:

Calm

Safe

Protected

Guided

Elevated

Curious

Connected to something higher

Your UI should evoke the feeling of temples + cosmos + wisdom + technology, seamlessly blended.



🎨 1.2 Visual Identity Principles

Cosmic + Spiritual Hybrid

Not a traditional astrology site.

Not a tech site.

A fusion.

Dark Spiritual Canvas

Deep Navy → #020916

Mystic Indigo → #0A0F2B

Cosmic Purple → #6E2DEB

Aura Cyan → #17E8F6

Ethereal Gold → #F2C94C

Soft Light, No Harsh Neon

Glows must be aura-like, not nightclub neon.

Sacred Geometry Everywhere

Mandalas

Sri-yantra patterns

Energy rings

Orbital paths

"Breathing" patterns

Particles Always Moving

Particle dust that moves like cosmic wind

Gentle energy orbs in the background

Not distracting, just alive

Circular UI Asset Shape System

Every important element uses circular influence:

Buttons: soft rounded pill

Cards: curved edges + aura glow

Icons: line-art circle mandala

This creates a visual language rooted in astrology.



🌌 1.3 Cosmic Animation Philosophy

All animations must follow:

✔ Subtle → Continuous → Meditative

No sharp motion

No sudden jumps

Everything flows like water

✔ Micro Interactions

Hover → glow softly

Click → ripple energy

Scroll → nebula shifts

Cursor move → stars follow lightly

✔ Page Transitions

Fade in with cosmic mist

Fade out with particle dissolve ("Thanos effect")

Mandala rotation fade

Soft blur → clarity reveal

✔ R3F (React-Three-Fiber) Scenes

Background should be:

Multi-layered

Dynamic

GPU-accelerated

Shader-driven

Layers:

Far background – Nebula clouds (shader)

Middle layer – Particle dust field (PointsMaterial)

Near layer – Mandala circles rotating slowly



🔊 1.4 Sound Identity

Your soundscape must feel divine but modern.

The sound tone:

Low-frequency hum

Airy chime

Soft temple bell echo

Subtle OM-frequency drones

No words, no chanting

Technologies:

Web Audio API looping nodes

Volume slider

Optional mute toggle



✨ 1.5 Interaction Personality

The UI should "behave" like a digital guru:

Slow guidance, not aggressive

Calming transitions

Breathing rhythm

Sacred pace

Discovery-based UI (reveals as user interacts)

This is the soul of the product.

💠 SECTION 6 COMPLETE

## PHASE 1 — SECTION 7

Cosmic Animation Architecture v1.0

This is the heart of your "magical" website.

This defines exactly how your cosmic universe works, how it looks, how it moves, how it feels.

You asked for:

✔ WebGL

✔ WebGPU

✔ Three.js

✔ React Three Fiber (R3F)

✔ GSAP ScrollTrigger

✔ Framer Motion

✔ Canvas shaders

✔ Particles

✔ Audio-reactive elements

✔ Cursor trails

✔ Dissolve effects

✔ Ambient soundscape

✔ Mixed themes (Nebula + Aurora + Mandala + Orbit)

You'll get all of them in a unified architecture that Cursor can implement step-by-step.



⭐ 7.0 — Vision of the Cosmic Layer

This layer sits behind all page content, inside <Canvas> (R3F), and controls:

Galaxy Field (Nebula)

Particle Universe (Stars)

Aurora Waves (Procedural Shader)

Mandala Geometry (3D Sacred Pattern)

Energy Rings (Orbit animation)

Cursor Trail (WebGL)

Page Transition Dissolve

Scroll-triggered 3D Motion

Ambient Soundscape

This is what agencies like Active Theory, Obys, Apple Vision Pro do.



🌌 7.1 — Core Architecture Layers

The cosmic system has 5 layers, stacked like this:

Layer 1 → Background Galaxy

Layer 2 → Nebula Fog + Aurora Shader

Layer 3 → Particle Universe

Layer 4 → Mandala / Rashi Wheel

Layer 5 → UI Effects (cursor, trails, dissolves)



Each layer is independent, reusable, and controlled by props so Cursor can generate/modify easily.



🌠 7.2 — Layer 1: Galaxy Background (R3F + Textures)

What it is

A super-soft deep space background:

Deep navy (#0B0D17)

Cosmic indigo

Faint gas clouds

Very subtle movement

Tech

Three.js plane

High-resolution nebula texture

Slight shader wobble

Low-performance mode for mobile

Movement

Slow drift XY

0.005 speed on desktop

Static on mobile



🌫 7.3 — Layer 2: Aurora + Nebula Shader (GLSL)

This section defines:

✔ Every screen in the entire system

✔ Layout

✔ Components

✔ Animations

✔ Interactions

✔ Transitions

✔ User flows

✔ Cosmic theme integration

✔ What Cursor will later generate in code

This is the UI/UX equivalent of a "master Figma file in words."

It ensures that Cursor can generate ALL screens later without confusion.

⭐ 15.0 — Purpose of Screen-by-Screen Blueprint

This document serves 4 roles:

Figma replacement — Cursor will build UI without a design tool.

Single source of truth for layout, components, animations.

Developer-ready blueprint — every screen is broken down into sections, interactions, and states.

Project-wide consistency for all future features.

🌠 SECTION 15 WILL BE BROKEN INTO 7 SUB-SECTIONS

To avoid overload and to help Cursor store each chunk cleanly,

Section 15 is divided into 7 subsections:

15.1 Website (Public)

Homepage, pricing, features, landing pages, footer, static pages.

15.2 Authentication Flow

Signup, login, magic link, email verification, onboarding intro.

15.3 Onboarding Flow

Birth details → geolocation → Rashi → Kundali generation → Welcome.

15.4 Dashboard Core

Horoscope, quick actions, timeline preview, Guru entry.

15.5 Deep Product Screens

Kundali, Predictions, Numerology, Palmistry, Aura, Reports.

15.6 Guru Chat (Full System)

Chat UI, context modes, animations, message types.

15.7 Profile, Settings & Notifications

Subscription flow, payment pages, notification center, user management.

Each one will be written with:

✔ Layout diagrams

✔ Component list

✔ Animations

✔ Micro-interactions

✔ Page transitions

✔ Cosmic background behavior

✔ R3F elements

✔ Sound triggers

✔ Accessibility

⭐ 15.1 — PUBLIC WEBSITE (Full Blueprint)

The public website must feel like a cosmic portal, designed to convert visitors into logged-in users.

⭐ Phase 1 - SECTION 15 (PART 2) — COMPLETE

# ⭐ Phase 2 — Cosmic Animation Architecture

## Section 1 — The Core Animation Engine (Foundations)

This is the BASE LAYER that powers everything else — galaxy, nebula, mandala, cursor trails, scroll effects.



🌌 1. THE COSMIC RENDERING ENGINE (CRE)

Your website will run on a custom 3-layer rendering architecture:

Layer 1 → Cosmic WebGL Background  (Three.js / R3F)

Layer 2 → Motion & Interaction     (GSAP + Framer Motion)

Layer 3 → UI Components            (Next.js + Tailwind)



⭐ Why this 3-layer design?

Because:

WebGL handles galaxy + particles + shaders

GSAP handles scroll animations, page transitions

Framer Motion handles UI micro-interactions

Everything remains smooth, efficient, and independent.

They combine into one final cosmic experience.

Nothing in backend changes.



🧿 SUMMARY OF PHASE 2 — SECTION 1 (Delivered)

✔ Architectural foundation

✔ Rendering stack

✔ File system

✔ Galaxy engine

✔ Nebula shaders

✔ Cursor effects

✔ Audio engine

✔ Page transition engine

✔ Camera controller

✔ Performance layer

## 🌌 Phase 2 — Section 2: Galaxy Scene Blueprint (FULL SPEC)

This is the master blueprint Cursor will use to generate the actual Three.js / R3F cosmos for Jyoti.app.

This is extremely detailed so that the implementation becomes pixel-perfect cosmic.



🌠 SECTION 2 — GALAXY SCENE BLUEPRINT

This section defines:

✔ Star particles

✔ Spiral arms

✔ Core glow

✔ Nebula layers

✔ Color gradients

✔ Motion rules

✔ Shaders

✔ Parallax

✔ Camera movement

✔ Performance rules

Everything Cursor needs to generate a world-class cosmic background.



🌌 1. GALAXY STRUCTURE

Your galaxy will follow a 4-armed spiral inspired by the Milky Way.

Arms: 4

Star count: 45,000 – 60,000

Galaxy radius: 10–12 units

Core radius: 1.2 units

Thickness: +-0.5 on the Y-axis



Each arm curves using a logarithmic spiral equation:

theta = random(0, 6.28 * 5)

radius = a * exp(b * theta)



Where:

a = 0.4

b = 0.22

This gives a beautiful natural spiral.



🌠 2. STAR PARTICLE SYSTEM

⭐ TOTAL STAR COUNT:

45,000 – 60,000

⭐ STAR TYPES (3 major categories)

Type

%

Size

Color

Core Stars

25%

1.0–1.6 px

Mystic Gold, Cosmic White

Spiral Stars

60%

0.8–1.3 px

Violet, Indigo, Sapphire

Distant Dust

15%

0.5 px

Deep Navy, Purple Mist



⭐ STAR COLOR GRADIENTS

Core (hot):

rgb(255, 249, 230)

rgb(255, 220, 160)

rgb(255, 190, 90)

Mid Zone (neutral):

rgb(185, 150, 255)

rgb(160, 130, 255)

rgb(130, 100, 230)

Outer Zone (cool):

rgb(80, 70, 140)

rgb(40, 35, 80)

Cursor will map star color depending on radius.



🌠 3. STAR MOVEMENT & DRIFT

Stars must appear alive.

⭐ Drift Rules:

x += noise1 * 0.002

y += noise2 * 0.0015

z += noise3 * 0.002



⭐ Twinkle Shader:

Each star's brightness oscillates:

brightness = base + sin(time * speed + offset) * intensity



Speed random: 0.5 – 2.0

Intensity: 0.2 – 0.4



🌌 4. NEBULA LAYERS (3-Layer Shader System)

Nebula is the "magic" behind your cosmic look.

Layer 1 — Base fog

Low opacity

Smooth color blend

Driven by Perlin noise

Colors: Indigo → Purple → Mystic Blue

Layer 2 — Cloud fractals

FBM noise

Higher contrast

Slowly shifting

Slight parallax

Layer 3 — Energy pulses

Thin glowing ribbons

Golden highlights

Moving with a sine wave

This makes it look alive and divine.



🎨 5. COLOR GRADIENT MAP (Master Cosmic Palette)

Primary:

Deep Space Navy: #05041c

Cosmic Indigo: #2a1f5d

Mystic Violet: #7b4bda

Sacred Purple: #a38efb

Glow:

Mandala Glow: rgba(255, 200, 100, 0.7)

Aura Glow: rgba(170, 100, 255, 0.5)

Cursor will automatically apply these to shaders.



🌀 6. INTERACTION — PARALLAX & ORBIT

Galaxy reacts to the user with controlled, elegant movement.

Parallax:

rotation.y += mouse.x * 0.0008

rotation.x += mouse.y * 0.0005



Auto Orbit (when user is idle):

rotation.y += 0.0004



Scroll-based camera motion:

0–25% scroll → zoom in

25–50% → slight pan

50–100% → slow rotation



🔮 7. SPECIAL COSMIC EFFECTS

1. Mandala Burst (page transition)

Golden mandala expands to full-screen

Dissolves via a GLSL noise pattern

Fades out

2. Energy Ripple (cursor click)

Circular ripple emanates from cursor

Glow + small particle burst

3. Dissolve Effect (section change)

Content dissolves into particles

Reform on next section

4. Nebula Pulse Sync

Connected to Web Audio frequency bands:

Low: nebula brightness pulse

Mid: star twinkle intensity

High: ripple highlights



🌠 8. CAMERA BLUEPRINT

Position:

Render particles with instancing

Add nebula shader mesh

Add camera controller

Add parallax

Add auto-orbit

Add audio-reactive layer

Add dissolve shader

Add mandala burst

Add color gradients

Optimize performance

Cursor can follow this sequence exactly.



🔥 SECTION 2 DELIVERED

Galaxy Scene Blueprint is complete.

## 🌫️ PHASE 2 — SECTION 3: NEBULA SHADER SYSTEM (FULL SPEC)

This defines the shaders, noise layers, color blending, animation, parallax, and performance rules.

This is the holy layer that gives Jyoti.app its mythical, spiritual, ethereal feeling.



🧩 1. OVERVIEW: THREE-LAYER NEBULA ARCHITECTURE

Your nebula will be built from 3 GLSL shader layers, each serving a purpose:

Layer A — Base Fog (Depth + Atmosphere)

Soft, slow-moving indigo fog that fills negative space.

Layer B — Cloud Fractals (Cosmic Clouds)

High-frequency fractal patterns with motion and color variation.

Layer C — Energy Ribbons (Sacred Golden Pulses)

Thin glowing swirls inspired by kundalini/mandala energy.

Each layer is blended using additive + soft-light modes.



🔮 2. GLSL SHADER ARCHITECTURE

A. Base Fog Shader (Layer 1)

Purpose:

Soft, atmospheric background

Large, slow-moving shapes

Smooth depth using volumetric noise

Noise algorithm:

float fog = fbm(uv * 0.3 + time * 0.02);



Base colors:

color1 = vec3(0.03, 0.02, 0.10)  // Deep Space Navy

color2 = vec3(0.09, 0.05, 0.22)  // Cosmic Indigo

color3 = vec3(0.18, 0.08, 0.45)  // Mystic Violet



Blend:

vec3 fogColor = mix(color1, color2, fog);

fogColor = mix(fogColor, color3, fog * 0.6);



Output opacity:

float alpha = fog * 0.45;





B. Fractal Cloud Shader (Layer 2)

Purpose:

Defined cosmic shapes

More texture

Spiritual cloud movement

Noise:

float n = fbm(uv * 1.2 + time * 0.12);

float clouds = smoothstep(0.3, 0.7, n);



Colors:

vec3 bright = vec3(0.45, 0.20, 0.75); // Sacred Purple

vec3 darker = vec3(0.12, 0.05, 0.25); // Indigo Shadow



Blend:

vec3 cloudColor = mix(darker, bright, clouds);



Opacity:

float alpha = clouds * 0.35;





C. Energy Ribbon Shader (Layer 3)

Purpose:

Kundalini-like glowing swirls

Mystic golden waves

Movement synced to sound (Phase 4)

Equation:

float ribbon = sin((uv.y * 4.0) + (time * 1.6)) 

             * sin((uv.x * 3.0) + (time * 1.0));

ribbon = smoothstep(0.45, 0.55, ribbon);



Colors:

vec3 gold1 = vec3(1.0, 0.85, 0.55);

vec3 gold2 = vec3(1.0, 0.70, 0.30);



Final Color:

vec3 ribbonColor = mix(gold1, gold2, ribbon);



Opacity:

float alpha = ribbon * 0.25;





🎨 3. COLOR PALETTE (OFFICIAL JYOTI.AI NEBULA)

Primary Nebula Colors

Deep Space Navy — #05041c

Cosmic Indigo — #2a1f5d

Mystic Violet — #7b4bda

Sacred Purple — #a38efb

Energy Glow Colors

Spiritual Gold — #ffd98a

Aura White — #fff5e6

Cursor integrates these into the shaders above.



🌀 4. ANIMATION RULES

Nebula MUST feel alive.

Global time multiplier:

float t = time * 0.2;   // very slow, graceful motion



Layer speeds:

Fog: 0.02

Clouds: 0.12

Ribbons: 1.6 (fastest)

Breathing Effect (global brightness pulse)

float breathe = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(time * 0.15);

finalColor *= 0.9 + breathe * 0.1;



Opacity Pulse (very subtle)

float opacityPulse = 0.97 + 0.03 * sin(time * 0.1);

alpha *= opacityPulse;





🎚 5. PARALLAX (Interaction Effect)

Nebula shifts slightly with mouse.

uv.x += mouse.x * 0.03;

uv.y += mouse.y * 0.02;



Creates the illusion of moving through a space cloud.



🔊 6. AUDIO-REACTIVE TIES (for Phase 4)

Later integration with Web Audio API:

Bass frequencies → fog brightness pulse

Mid frequencies → cloud pulsation

High frequencies → ribbon shimmer

Shader uniforms will include:

uniform float bass;

uniform float mid;

uniform float high;



Cursor will integrate this in Phase 4.



⚙️ 7. PERFORMANCE RULES

Nebula shader should:

✔ Render on a full-screen quad

✔ Use low/no geometry

✔ Run at 60fps on mobile

✔ Support dynamic pixel ratio lowering

Cursor-specific rules:

Use useFrame() efficiently

Move heavy calculations into GLSL

Avoid React state inside animation loop

Use dpr={[1, 1.5]} on Canvas

Tree-shake unused R3F components



🧱 8. FILE STRUCTURE FOR CURSOR

Cursor must create:

/lib/3d/shaders/nebula/

   nebulaFragment.glsl

   nebulaVertex.glsl

   fogNoise.glsl

   fbm.glsl

   ribbonNoise.glsl



/lib/3d/components/

   NebulaLayer.tsx

   NebulaComposite.tsx

   GalaxyScene.tsx (from prev section)



/lib/3d/controllers/

   ParallaxController.ts

   AudioReactiveController.ts



Each shader is isolated for clarity.



🚀 9. IMPLEMENTATION ORDER FOR CURSOR

Create /shaders/nebula folder

Add noise functions (Perlin, FBM)

Implement base fog

Add fractal clouds

Add energy ribbons

Blend the three layers

Wrap in <NebulaComposite /> component

Add parallax

Connect audio uniforms

Integrate into <GalaxyScene />

Optimize performance



🌟 SECTION 3 DELIVERED

Nebula Shader System is fully defined.

## 🌌 PHASE 2 — SECTION 4 — PARTICLE UNIVERSE ENGINE

(50,000–150,000 particles • GPU-driven • astrology-inspired)

This is the most visually important layer after the Nebula Shader.

Particles = "Jyoti" (light)

This is the true identity of Jyoti.ai → a universe made of spiritual lights.



⭐️ 1. OVERVIEW OF THE PARTICLE SYSTEM

The Particle Universe Engine contains four particle zones, rendered with instanced meshes + GLSL shaders for maximum performance.

ZONE A — Deep Starfield (50,000 particles)

distant

slow-moving

tiny

pure ✨ twinkle

ZONE B — Mid Starfield (20,000 particles)

medium distance

mild parallax

color variation

ZONE C — Foreground Sparkles (5,000 particles)

close

slow drift

shimmer

ZONE D — Sacred Geometry Particle Rings (3 rings × 1,200 particles each)

Rings rotate slowly to match:

12 zodiac signs

9 planets

Chakra positions



🧱 2. PARTICLE ENGINE ARCHITECTURE

All particles share the same pattern:

InstancedMesh (THREE)

GPU-driven movement (Vertex shader)

Twinkle + shimmer (Fragment shader)

Noise-driven drift

Depth-based fade





🔮 3. GLSL SHADERS (Complete Spec)

A. Vertex Shader

Handles:

position

noise drift

parallax offsets

scale pulsation

Vertex Noise

float n = fbm(position.xyz * 0.1 + time * 0.08);

vec3 displaced = position + normal * n * 0.5;



Parallax

displaced.xy += mouse.xy * (0.001 * depthFactor);



Scale pulse

float pulse = sin(time * 0.2 + n * 5.0) * 0.3;

size = baseSize + pulse;





B. Fragment Shader

Handles:

glow

twinkle

color variation

Twinkle logic:

float twinkle = sin(time * freq + noise * 5.0) * 0.5 + 0.5;



Glow:

float glow = smoothstep(0.95, 1.0, twinkle);



Color palette:

Use ASTRO color gradients:

vec3 palette1 = vec3(1.0, 0.95, 0.88);  // Aura white

vec3 palette2 = vec3(0.75, 0.55, 1.0);  // Mystic purple

vec3 palette3 = vec3(1.0, 0.78, 0.37);  // Sacred gold



Blend:

vec3 color = mix(palette1, palette2, noise);

color = mix(color, palette3, glow * 0.4);





🌠 4. PARTICLE DISTRIBUTION

ZONE A — Deep Starfield

count = 50,000

distribution = spherical (radius 150–300)

baseSize = 0.5

twinkleFreq = low (0.1–0.3)



ZONE B — Mid Starfield

count = 20,000

distribution = displaced sphere (radius 80–150)

baseSize = 0.7

twinkleFreq = medium (0.4–0.8)



ZONE C — Foreground Sparkles

count = 5,000

distribution = ring + spiral

baseSize = 1.1

twinkleFreq = high (1.0–1.7)



ZONE D — Sacred Geometry Rings

Each ring:

count = 1200 particles

radius = 20, 25, 30

rotationSpeed = 0.02, 0.015, 0.01

alignment = zodiac angles (12 segments)





🌀 5. ANIMATION SYSTEM

Particles move using:

Noise Drift

position.xyz += fbm(position.xyz * 0.05 + time * 0.1) * 0.4;



Orbit Motion

Used for the rings:

angle += rotationSpeed * delta;

position.x = cos(angle) * radius;

position.z = sin(angle) * radius;



Random Micro-Jitter

position.xy += vec2(

  sin(time * 4.0 + id),

  cos(time * 3.0 + id * 2.0)

) * 0.02;





🧭 6. INTERACTION MODEL

Mouse Parallax

All particles shift slightly:

displaced.xy += mouse.xy * depthFactor * 0.01;



Cursor Aura (ENABLED)

When cursor moves:

nearby particles brighten

foreground sparkles stretch

ring particles pulse slightly

Shader must include cursor pos uniform.



🔊 7. AUDIO REACTIVITY (Phase 4)

Particle brightness responds to audio:

Bass → deep stars pulse

Mid → mid stars shimmer

High → foreground sparkles flash

Shader uniforms:

uniform float bass;

uniform float mid;

uniform float treble;





⚙️ 8. PERFORMANCE RULES

Particles must run at:

✔ 60 FPS desktop

✔ 45+ FPS mobile

Rules:

Always use InstancedMesh

No React state inside render loop

Use react-three-fiber + useFrame()

Use dynamic DPR: [1, 1.4]

Use frustum culling

Load the particle system lazily

Offload math to GLSL

✅ SECTION 4 COMPLETE

We now have the complete Particle Universe Engine Spec.

## 🔥 PHASE 2 — SECTION 5 — KUNDALINI ENERGY WAVE SYSTEM

(Golden serpent waves • Chakra pulses • Spine-axis animation layer)

This system represents the Kundalini Shakti — the rising energy through the chakras.

It sits behind the UI, above Galaxy + Nebula + Particles, but below text/UI components.

This is the soul layer of the interface.



🌟 1. PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM

The Kundalini Energy Wave System must evoke:

rising spiritual vibration

divine energy flow

meditative calm

cosmic intelligence

subtle, infinite waves

It directly affects brand identity — Jyoti = "Inner light".

This effect is subtle, elegant, mesmerising.



🧬 2. SYSTEM COMPONENTS

This engine consists of 4 sub-systems:

1. Kundalini Spine Axis

A vertical energy column in the center of the screen.

Not visually shown — only its influence appears through wave forms.

2. Dual Serpent Flow (Ida & Pingala)

Two sinusoidal energy waves (left & right):

gold (Pingala — sun)

silver/blue (Ida — moon)

3. Chakra Pulse Emitters

7 pulse emitters located at chakra positions:

Root

Sacral

Solar

Heart

Throat

Third Eye

Crown

Each chakra emits:

radial ripple waves

soft glow pulses

micro particles

4. Aura Wave Sheet

A large shimmering wave sheet behind everything.



🎨 3. COLOR SPECIFICATION

Golden Kundalini Energy:

#FFCC66 (base gold)

#FFD98E (highlight)

#FFB84D (deep gold)



Silver / Moon Energy:

#D9E5FF (base)

🧠 5. LOGIC OF THE SYSTEM

A. Spine Axis

Invisible, but provides:

positional anchors

chakra coordinates

wave offsets

Coordinates:

y = [-2.5, -1.6, -0.8, 0.0, 0.8, 1.6, 2.4] // 7 chakras

x = 0 // center





B. Serpent Flow (Ida & Pingala Paths)

Each serpent = a rotating sine wave tube.

GLSL logic:

float wave = sin(position.y * frequency + time * speed);

position.x += wave * amplitude;



Attributes:

amplitude = 0.3

frequency = 2.2

speed = 1.4





C. Chakra Pulse Emitters

Each chakra:

emits radial ripple

emits particles

pulses at 0.5–1.2 Hz

Ripple shader:

float ripple = sin(distance * 8.0 - time * 3.0);

alpha = smoothstep(0.9, 1.0, ripple);



Glow shader:

float glow = exp(-distance * 2.5);

color += glow * chakraColor;



Particle spray:

20–40 micro-particles per chakra

orbit + jitter



D. Aura Wave Sheet (Main Beautiful Layer)

Full-screen wave sheet with:

Perlin Noise

FBM distortion

Amplitude modulation

Chakra alignment

GLSL:

float n = fbm(uv * 3.0 + time * 0.3);

float wave = sin(uv.y * 10.0 + n * 4.0 + time * 2.0);



Color blending:

vec3 base = mix(deepPurple, mysticBlue, n);

vec3 highlight = chakraBlend * wave;

color = base + highlight * 0.1;





🔮 6. AUDIO REACTIVITY

If sound is ON:

Crown chakra pulses with treble

Solar plexus pulses with mid

Root pulses with bass

Uniforms added:

uniform float bass;

uniform float mid;

uniform float treble;





🌀 7. INTERACTION MODEL

Interactions:

Mouse vertical movement → wave amplitude change

Cursor hover over chakra → glow intensifies

Scroll → serpents unwinding effect

Cursor-specific effect:

float dist = distance(chakraPos, cursorPos);

glow *= 1.0 / dist;





📉 8. PERFORMANCE TARGETS

This layer must run at:

60 FPS desktop

40+ FPS mobile

Optimization via:

Instanced meshes

Batched particles

GPU-based waves

No React state in loop

Suspense + lazy load

🧨 10. FINAL VISUAL EFFECT

What this will look like on screen:

two flowing serpents dancing slowly

soft golden/silver energy rising

chakras glowing gently

wave-sheet shimmering behind

everything tied to the cosmic scene

movement synced with breath-like rhythm

meditative + immersive

This is one of the most iconic layers of Jyoti.ai.



🌙 SECTION 5 COMPLETE

## 🌟 PHASE 2 — SECTION 6

Cosmic Cursor Trail System (Jyoti Trail Engine)

This section defines your signature cursor experience — a spiritual, cosmic, non-cheap effect that feels premium, meditative, and alive.

No childish sparkles. It has to feel like conscious light following the user.



1️⃣ GOAL & FEEL

The cursor trail should feel like:

A moving orb of aura energy

Dragging soft light threads behind it

Slightly reacting to chakra + galaxy energy

Sometimes "absorbing" stars near it

100% smooth, no lag, no clutter

We'll call this subsystem:

JyotiTrail Engine



2️⃣ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

Tech stack:

R3F (React Three Fiber) → actual trail geometry in WebGL

GSAP → easing for trails & orbs

Anime.js → particle bursts on clicks

Framer Motion → small UI hover effects tied to cursor proximity

Pointer events from React → route to WebGL

Structure:

/lib/3d/cursor/

  JyotiTrail.tsx

  CursorAura.tsx

  ClickBurst.tsx

  CursorController.ts



/lib/3d/shaders/cursor/

  cursorTrailVertex.glsl

  cursorTrailFragment.glsl

  auraOrbFragment.glsl

  clickBurstFragment.glsl





3️⃣ TRAIL DESIGN — WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

A. Cursor Core

Not the OS pointer itself, but a glowing orb following it with 10–20ms delay

Colors:

Inner: Aura White (#FFF5E6)

Outer: Mystic Violet (#7B4BDA)

Edge: Gold Accent (#FFD98A)

Size: 16–22px (responsive)

Glow: soft, feathered, no hard edge

B. Trail

Soft, smoke-like streak

Slight tapering:

Thick near cursor

Thin as it fades out

Trail length: last 0.5–0.8 seconds of movement

Opacity: slowly fading with time

C. Energy Sparks

Tiny particles (2–3px)

Spawn along trail at random intervals

Drift away + fade



4️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL

4.1 — CursorController

Listens to mousemove events

Stores last N positions (e.g., 40–60 points)

Smooths them using interpolation:

const smoothed = lerp(previous, current, 0.2);





Sends positions to JyotiTrail and CursorAura via R3F.

4.2 — JyotiTrail Component

Geometry:

Use a catmull-rom spline through the last positions

Sample the spline into 40–60 segments

Render as:

Either triangle strip line with varying width OR

Instanced quads along spline points

Width falloff:

float t = segmentIndex / totalSegments;

float width = mix(maxWidth, minWidth, t); // taper effect



Opacity falloff:

float alpha = pow(1.0 - t, 1.5);



Color:

Blend between violet and gold based on speed:

vec3 slowColor = vec3(0.48, 0.30, 0.82); // violet

vec3 fastColor = vec3(1.0, 0.85, 0.54);  // gold

vec3 color = mix(slowColor, fastColor, speedFactor);



speedFactor computed from distance between last few cursor points.



4.3 — CursorAura Component

Renders a billboarded quad at cursor position.

Uses auraOrbFragment.glsl:

Shader logic:

vec2 centered = uv - 0.5;

float dist = length(centered);

float aura = smoothstep(0.5, 0.0, dist); // circular fade

float ring = smoothstep(0.4, 0.35, dist);



vec3 base = vec3(1.0, 0.96, 0.9); // inner aura

vec3 edge = vec3(0.94, 0.75, 1.0); // outer violet

vec3 color = mix(edge, base, aura);



float glow = aura + ring * 0.6;

color *= glow;

alpha = glow * 0.9;



Slight breathing effect:

float breathe = 0.95 + 0.05 * sin(time * 1.2);

color *= breathe;





4.4 — ClickBurst Component

Triggered on mousedown:

Uses Anime.js or GSAP to quickly create:

12–16 particles radiating outward

small rings expanding and fading

Visual behavior:

Duration: 400–700ms

Ease: power3.out

Color: gold + white + violet mix

Size: starts at 0 → expands → fades out

This appears only on significant interactions, not every micro-click.



5️⃣ INTERACTION WITH OTHER LAYERS

5.1 — Galaxy & Particles

Particles near cursor (within radius R) slightly:

brighten by +20–30%

shift position by a tiny vector towards cursor (gravity feel)

Shader uniform:

uniform vec2 cursorPos;

uniform float cursorInfluenceRadius;



Effect:

float d = distance(worldPos.xy, cursorPos);

float influence = smoothstep(cursorInfluenceRadius, 0.0, d);

brightness += influence * 0.3;



5.2 — Nebula

Subtle: nebula brightness increases a bit around cursor.

Max effect: +10% to avoid visual chaos.



6️⃣ MOBILE & LOW-POWER MODE

On touch devices:

Full trail can be heavy → auto downgrade:

Rules:

On mobile:

Use shorter trail (only aura orb) or minimal 5–10 segments.

Reduce particle count.

Reduce glow intensity.

Provide a global flag:

const prefersLowMotion = usePrefersReducedMotion();





If low motion:

Disable trail

Only show soft smoothed aura circle

No click bursts



7️⃣ ACCESSIBILITY & SETTINGS

Under User Settings → Visual Effects:

Toggles:

 Enable Cosmic Cursor Trail

 Enable Particle Attraction

 Enable Click Bursts

 Respect "Reduce Motion" OS Setting

Cursor must read these flags from store and conditionally render.



8️⃣ FILE STRUCTURE FOR CURSOR

/lib/3d/cursor/

  CursorController.ts

  JyotiTrail.tsx

  CursorAura.tsx

  ClickBurst.tsx



/lib/3d/shaders/cursor/

  cursorTrailVertex.glsl

## 🌟 PHASE 2 — SECTION 7

Page Transition & Scene Orchestration Engine

(Barba.js + GSAP + R3F Scene Switching)

This is the heart of the "super-premium" mystical transitions that only award-winning websites use.

We are now building your Jyoti Transition Engine — a unified system that handles:

Page transitions

Scene swaps

Dissolve animations

Entry/exit timings

Camera repositioning

Shader switching

Scroll-reset logic

Soundscape modulation

Global UI freeze/unfreeze

This is what turns Jyoti.app into a world-class, cinematic spiritual OS.

Let's go deep.



🧿 1. GOAL OF THIS SYSTEM

When the user switches between any page:

Dashboard → Reports → Guru → Kundali → Numerology → Profile → Aura/Palmistry → Home

The transition should feel like:

The universe contracting

A mandala dissolving

A new cosmic layer forming

The camera gliding into a new dimension

The UI appearing like conscious light

Your website becomes a living organism, not just navigation.



✨ 2. TECHNOLOGY STACK FOR TRANSITIONS

✔ Barba.js

Single Page Transition Coordinator (route → lifecycle hooks).

✔ GSAP

Animations, fluids, easing, timelines, staggering.

✔ GSAP ScrollTrigger

Scroll & scene sync (for long pages).

✔ React Three Fiber (WebGL Scene Layer)

Camera transitions, light transitions, shader mixing.

✔ Emotion/Framer Motion

UI fade + micro interaction control.

✔ Shader-driven Dissolve (GLSL)

For "Thanos-style" disintegration.



🔱 3. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

/lib/transitions/

  - transitionManager.ts

  - barbaConfig.ts

  - pageScenes.ts

  - sceneOrchestrator.ts

  - dissolveShader.glsl

  - mandalaShader.glsl



These modules control:

which animation runs on route leave

which transition effect to use

how R3F 3D scene should change

audio changes (volume, filter, pads)

restoring scroll positions

perf guards for mobile



🛕 4. TYPES OF TRANSITIONS (we will use ALL)

Type 1: Mandala Dissolve (Trademark Transition)

A mandala glyph grows behind content

Page dissolves into sacred geometry particles

New page fades in through mandala center

Shader-driven noise dissolve

Soft gold, violet, and aura white

Shader Pseudocode:

float dissolve = smoothstep(threshold, threshold + 0.1, noise(uv * 4.0 + time));

alpha = 1.0 - dissolve;





Type 2: Galaxy Warp (3D Camera Move)

Camera in R3F scene moves forward

Stars stretch into streaks

New page appears as camera "drops out of warp"

Used for:

Dashboard → Guru

Dashboard → Reports



Type 3: Chakra Pulse Fade

Seven chakra nodes briefly glow, in a wave:

Order:

Muladhara → Svadhisthana → Manipura → Anahata → Vishuddha → Ajna → Sahasrara

UI fades in with each chakra pulse.

Colors follow chakra rules:

Red → Orange → Yellow → Green → Blue → Indigo → Violet



Type 4: Particle Sweep Transition

Particles sweep from left-to-right or circular pattern.

Perfect for:

Report viewer → Dashboard



🌌 5. LIFECYCLE (Barba.js Hooks)

## 🌌 PHASE 2 — SECTION 8

AUDIO ATMOSPHERE ENGINE v1.0

(Spiritual Ambient Soundscape + Interactive Audio System)

This is the full architecture for the Jyoti Cosmic Audio layer — the mystical hum that plays beneath the UI and binds the cosmic animations, transitions, and the entire experience.

It is not music.

It is not mantra chanting.

It is pure spiritual sound design.

Think:

Tibetan bowls

Cosmic hum

Breath-like textures

Soft shimmering pads

Subtle "Om-like vibration" (but without speaking words)

This is the sound of the universe awakening.



🧿 1. SYSTEM GOAL

Create a continuous, seamless, low-frequency ambient environment that reacts to:

Page transitions

Chakra pulses

Kundalini waves

Drag/swipe/click interactions

Scenes (Home, Dashboard, Guru, Reports, Kundali)

User settings (toggle ON/OFF, reduce intensity)

The Audio Atmosphere Engine should:

✔ Never distract

✔ Never chant words

✔ Remain soft

✔ Feel divine

✔ Feel cosmic

✔ Sync with R3F animation

✔ Change "energy patterns" based on page type



🔊 2. TECHNOLOGY STACK

We use pure web technologies, no paid asset necessary.

✔ Web Audio API

Core sound engine. Oscillators, filters, automations, envelopes.

✔ Howler.js (optional fallback)

Polished playback of pre-designed loops.

✔ GSAP

To animate volume and filter fades.

✔ Tone.js (optional advanced mode)

For procedural pads, Tibetan bells, and sound modulation.

## 🌟 PHASE 2 — SECTION 9

MICRO-INTERACTION ENGINE v1.0

(Hover Glows • Magnetic Buttons • Cursor Forces • Astro Icons • Page Micro-Animations)

This section defines the full micro-interaction architecture that will transform Jyoti.app into a next-level, premium, magical, interactive cosmic experience.

These are the tiny details that make a website feel alive.

Apple, Dyson, Nothing Phone, and Nike rely heavily on micro-interactions to create emotion.

We will do the same — but with a spiritual twist.



🧩 1. PURPOSE OF THE MICRO-INTERACTION ENGINE

Micro-interactions will serve 4 purposes:

✔ 1) Visual delight

When the user hovers, clicks, moves the mouse — the website responds.

✔ 2) Meaningful feedback

Hover states, loading animations, vibrations tied to astrology.

✔ 3) Emotional experience

User feels the "energy" of the universe through tiny visual cues.

✔ 4) Enhancement of navigation

Smooth transitions, snappy UI, animated content blocks.



🧿 2. TECHNOLOGIES USED

To build micro-interactions at a cinematic level, we use:

Core:

Framer Motion — for component animations

GSAP — for scroll-trigger & tween controls

Anime.js — for SVG icon morphing

Barba.js — for page transitions (paired with our shader system)

Add-ons:

WebGL (R3F) — cursor-based distortions

CSS Variables + Tailwind — for glow, blur, borders

Web Audio API — (optional) soft shimmer on hover

All tools work inside Next.js with Cursor.



🌈 3. THE 10 MICRO-INTERACTION CATEGORIES

We break micro-interactions into 10 systems:

Hover Glow System

Magnetic Button System

Cursor Physics Engine

Astro Icon Micro-Motion

Text Interaction System

Form Input Micro-Animations

Card Reveal & Hover System

Progress & Loading System

List & Table Micro-Animations

Component Appearance Variants

Each one is detailed below.



🔥 4. SYSTEM 1 — Hover Glow Engine

Applies to buttons, cards, icons.

Behavior:

Soft cosmic glow (purple/orange/blue based on theme)

120–180ms fade in

Follows cursor slightly (GSAP pointer tracking)

Optional shimmer effect

Implementation:

<motion.button

  whileHover={{ 

    boxShadow: "0 0 25px rgba(var(--cosmic), 0.6)", 

    scale: 1.05 

  }}

  transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 200, damping: 15 }}

>

  Continue

</motion.button>



Advanced (Three.js distortion):

Cursor causes "energy ripple" over the button background

Subtle, only on desktop



🧲 5. SYSTEM 2 — Magnetic Button Engine

This gives "gravity pull" toward buttons.

Behavior:

When cursor enters a 100px radius → button moves slightly toward cursor

When cursor leaves → snaps back with elastic ease

Code (simplified):

gsap.to(button, {

  x: (cursor.x - button.centerX) * 0.2,

  y: (cursor.y - button.centerY) * 0.2,

  duration: 0.3,

  ease: "power3.out"

});



Usage:

Primary CTA (Get Prediction)

Start Guru Chat

Generate Report

Purchase Premium



🪬 6. SYSTEM 3 — Cosmic Cursor Physics Engine

Matches the cosmic theme perfectly.

Cursor reacts with:

Small light orb following mouse

Trail particles fading out

Chakra pulses on click

Astrological glyphs appear for 200–400ms on certain clicks

Implementation:

Canvas overlay

R3F particle emitters

Color shifts based on chakra

States:

Hover → bright orb

Idle → soft glow

Click → ripple + glyph



♒ 7. SYSTEM 4 — Astro Icon Micro-Motion

All icons (Sun, Moon, Grahas, etc.) move subtly:

Effects:

Slow breathing (scale up/down)

Orbit wobble

Shine shimmer

Stroke animating (using Anime.js)

Example:

anime({

  targets: '#sun-icon path',

  strokeDashoffset: [anime.setDashoffset, 0],

  easing: 'easeInOutSine',

  duration: 1500,

  loop: true,

  direction: 'alternate'

});



These micro-motions give "soul" to the celestial icons.



✨ 8. SYSTEM 5 — Text Interaction System

Types of interactions:

Word fade-in stagger

Digital "energy flicker" text animation

Glow on hover

Astrological emojis floating beside text

Mantra glyphs appearing for 1s timer

For headlines:

<motion.h1

  initial="hidden"

  animate="visible"

  variants={{

    hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 10 },

    visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { staggerChildren: 0.05 } }

  }}

>

  Divine Insight Awaits

</motion.h1>





🌬 9. SYSTEM 6 — Form Input Micro-Animations

Form fields are polished like iOS:

Label floats smoothly

Input glow on focus

Border expands from center

Submission causes ripple effect

Error vibrates lightly

## 🌌 PHASE 2 — SECTION 10

SCROLL INTERACTION ENGINE v1.0

(The engine that controls scroll-based animations across the entire Jyoti.app front-end)

This system creates the cinematic, premium, Apple-level scroll experience that you want:

Parallax nebula layers

Section reveals

Page storytelling

Cosmic motion tied to scroll

3D galaxy reacting to scroll

Text + image stagger reveals

Deep-dive prediction cards animating into view

Aura glow changes while scrolling

Shaders transforming based on scroll speed

It is built for Next.js + React using:

✔ GSAP ScrollTrigger

✔ Locomotive Scroll / Lenis

✔ React Three Fiber (R3F)

✔ Custom Shaders

✔ Framer Motion

✔ Barba.js (optional for page-to-page)

Let's start.

🧿 1. PURPOSE OF THE SCROLL ENGINE

The Scroll Interaction Engine controls:

✔ Page motion

Cosmic sections sliding in, mandala layers moving subtly, background reacting.

✔ 3D scene synchronization

As the user scrolls, the galaxy rotates, particles drift, nebula shifts.

✔ Text storytelling

Lines appear one by one, staggered smoothly.

✔ Parallax depth

Foreground moves faster, background moves slower → cinematic depth.

✔ Energy-based UI

Scroll velocity adds "energy pulses" to the scene.

✔ Cosmic reveals

Cards, sections, dividers appear with a magical reveal animation.

🌬 2. TECHNOLOGIES INSIDE THE ENGINE

Mandatory stack

✔ GSAP ScrollTrigger

✔ Lenis (smooth scroll)

✔ React Three Fiber

✔ Tailwind CSS

✔ Framer Motion

Optional advanced tools

✔ Barba.js (for page transitions + scroll resets)

✔ WebGL shaders tied to scroll

✔ Anime.js for SVG icon scroll animations

Everything is 100% compatible with Cursor.

🌌 3. SMOOTH SCROLL ENGINE (LENIS)

We replace default browser scroll with buttery smooth scroll.

Install:

npm install @studio-freight/lenis

Basic setup:

// app/layout.tsx

"use client";

import Lenis from "@studio-freight/lenis";

import { useEffect } from "react";

export function SmoothScrollWrapper({ children }) {

  useEffect(() => {

    const lenis = new Lenis({

      duration: 1.2,

      smooth: true,

      easing: (t) => 1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 3),

    });

    function raf(time) {

      lenis.raf(time);

      requestAnimationFrame(raf);

    }

    requestAnimationFrame(raf);

  }, []);

  return <>{children}</>;

}

This enables:

✔ Ultra-smooth scrolling

✔ Precise scroll tracking

✔ Slow-motion "cosmic" feel

🌠 4. PARALLAX ENGINE (Cosmic Multi-Layered Background)

We create a 3-layered deep-space parallax:

Layer 1: Far Nebula (moves slowest)

Layer 2: Mid-layer Galaxy

Layer 3: Foreground Stars (moves fastest)

Using ScrollTrigger:

gsap.to('.nebula-layer', {

  yPercent: -20,

  scrollTrigger: { trigger: '.hero', scrub: true }

});

gsap.to('.stars-layer', {

  yPercent: -40,

  scrollTrigger: { trigger: '.hero', scrub: true }

});

This gives a premium depth effect.

🌌 5. SECTION REVEAL ENGINE

Every section fade + slide + reveal is controlled using Framer Motion + GSAP.

Basic reveal:

<motion.section

  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 40 }}

  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}

  transition={{ duration: 0.8, ease: "easeOut" }}

  viewport={{ once: true }}

>

  ...

</motion.section>

We add:

Glow-on-reveal

Particle "dust" emission

Soft energy pulse

🌪 6. 3D GALAXY SYNC ENGINE

The 3D scene reacts to scroll:

Effects:

Rotate galaxy as the user scrolls

Speed increases on fast scroll

Trigger shader distortions on scroll events

Stars drift according to scrolldelta

Example:

useFrame(({ clock }, delta) => {

  galaxyRef.current.rotation.y += scrollVelocity * 0.0005;

  nebulaMaterial.uniforms.uScroll.value = scrollPosition;

});

This merges your scroll with cosmic physics.

🌌 7. SCROLL-BASED SHADER TRANSFORMATIONS

Shaders change based on scroll:

Nebula color shift

Particle emission rate

Aura bloom intensity

Chakra pulses

Example:

uniform float uScroll;

color = mix(color1, color2, smoothstep(0.0, 1.0, uScroll));

This creates spiritual scene transitions.

✨ 8. PREDICTION CARD REVEAL ENGINE

Cards animate with:

Glow rise

Soft pop

Chakra line hover

Text stagger

Example:

<motion.div

  variants={cardVariants}

  initial="hidden"

  whileInView="visible"

  viewport={{ once: true }}

/>

Feels like "knowledge appearing".

🌈 9. AURA-SCROLL REACTIVITY

User scroll changes the aura background:

Color hue shift

Pulse at section boundaries

Glow intensity change

This reflects the spiritual "state of journey".

🧿 10. TEXT STORYTELLING ENGINE

As the user scrolls:

Lines appear in sequence

Glyph emissions appear

Section headers glow

This builds cinematic storytelling.

⭐ 11. PAGE TRANSITION SCROLL RESET SYSTEM

Using Barba.js:

Scroll resets on page change

Fade-in cosmic background

Slide + dissolve content

Gives your site an app-like feel.

## 🌌 PHASE 2 — SECTION 11

PAGE-LEVEL WORLD COMPOSITION ENGINE v1.0

(How every page becomes its own "cosmic environment" while staying connected to the global universe)

This section explains how we design, structure, and orchestrate each page of Jyoti.app as a mini cinematic world, but still part of the Unified Cosmic Universe created in earlier sections.

This is where your website becomes a spiritual 3D universe, not a normal website.



🌟 1. WHAT IS WORLD COMPOSITION?

Every page on the website becomes a scene with:

Its own 3D background

Its own energy theme

Its own lighting

Its own scroll behavior

Its own micro-interactions

Its own shader dynamics

But all scenes share:

A global galaxy container

R3F renderer

Background music engine

Universal color theme

Unified design system

This gives consistency + individuality.

Think like:

👉 Each page = a different temple in the same spiritual universe.



🌈 2. GLOBAL WORLD VS. PAGE WORLDS

🪐 GLOBAL WORLD (Layout-Level)

Exists in layout.tsx:

Main galaxy background

🔮 10. STORYTELLING LAYOUT SPECIFICATION

Every page follows the cinematic structure:

Hero (scene + title)

↓

Narrative section (text + cosmic motion)

↓

Interactive section (cards + R3F elements)

↓

CTA / next-step gateway



This creates a flowing, spiritual experience.



🧩 11. RESPONSIVE & MOBILE STRATEGY

Because 3D can overload mobile:

Desktop

✔ Full 3D galaxy

✔ Shaders

✔ Particles

✔ Scroll interactions

Mobile

✖ Complex shaders off

✖ R3F galaxy replaced with Lottie animation

✔ Soft gradients

✔ Micro-interactions only

Cursor will automatically handle both.



🧠 SECTION 11 COMPLETE

You now have:

Full page-world architecture

Page-specific cosmic scenes

Shader and lighting presets

Storytelling layouts

File structure

Mobile fallback

Transition engine

Your website will behave like a premium, spiritual sci-fi operating system.

## 🌠 PHASE 2 — SECTION 12

PERFORMANCE, FALLBACKS & MOBILE STRATEGY v1.0

(How your cosmic 3D website runs smoothly on every device without lag, overheating, or crashes)

This section is mission-critical because cosmic 3D environments, GLSL shaders, particles and scroll-driven animation can overload CPU/GPU on weaker devices.

To ship a world-class product, you must combine:

GPU optimization

Dynamic fallbacks

Adaptive rendering

Selective enabling

Mobile-specific render rules

This ensures:

✔ Smooth 60 FPS on desktop

✔ No overheating on mobile

✔ No animation lag

✔ No browser crashes

✔ SEO remains strong



⭐ 1. PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY

jyoti.app must feel:

Light, fluid, magical, and effortless.

Performance must be:

Predictable

Scalable

Stable

Intelligent (device-aware)

Graceful under load

We never want:

Heavy shader freezing

3D scenes lagging

Phone overheating

Safari crashing



🚀 2. DEVICE CAPABILITY DETECTION ENGINE

Every user's device will be categorized before activating any cosmic animation.

We detect:

Hardware capabilities

GPU type

GPU memory

CPU cores

Browser support for WebGL / WebGPU

GPU benchmarking (quick sample)

Max texture size

Network

Slow 3G / fast 5G

Offline fallback

Device type

Desktop

Laptop

Tablet

Mobile

Result → Device Profile

We generate a profile:

Profile

Name

Description

Rendering Mode

P1

Ultra

High-end GPU

Full 3D + Shaders

P2

Pro

Decent laptop/desktop

Medium shaders + particles

P3

Standard

Basic device

Minimal particles + simplified shaders

P4

Lite

Older mobiles

Lottie BG + gradients

P5

Safe Mode

Very weak

No 3D, no particles



This allows adaptive rendering.



💨 3. ADAPTIVE RENDERING LOGIC

After detection:

If P1–P2:

 → Enable full cosmic world (R3F + shaders + nebula + particles)

If P3:

 → Disable heavy shaders

 → Keep mid-weight particles

 → Keep cursor trail

If P4:

 → Replace 3D with Lottie/WebM animations

 → Soft gradients

 → Light parallax

If P5:

 → No animations

 → Static images

 → Pure CSS visuals

Cursor will generate this logic automatically.



🎮 4. UNIFIED PERFORMANCE SETTINGS

We implement the following global optimizations:

✔ Render throttling

Limit R3F render loop when user is idle or tab is hidden.

✔ Pixel ratio downscaling

On mobile:

dpr={[1, 1.5]}



On high-end desktop:

dpr={[1, 2]}



✔ Framerate limiting

Cap at 30–45 FPS on mobile to prevent heating.

✔ OffscreenCanvas (if WebGPU/WebGL2 supported)

Moves heavy processing off the main UI thread.

✔ Lazy loading everything

Scenes

Shaders

Particles

Audio engine

Interaction modules

Heavy components only load when user scrolls into them.



🌈 5. SHADER PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

We optimize GLSL shaders:

Remove

❌ heavy loops

❌ complex raymarching

❌ unnecessary uniforms

Use

✔ simplex noise (cheap)

✔ small texture fetches

✔ precomputed LUTs

✔ baked light maps

Fragment shader rule

Try to keep under:

40 instructions mobile

100 instructions desktop

Vertex shader rule

Keep transformations extremely light.

Cursor will optimize these automatically.



⚡ 6. PARTICLE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION

Particles account for 60% of GPU load.

We manage load via:

✔ Instancing

One geometry, multiple instances = massive performance improvements.

✔ Sorting disabled

We use additive blending; no need to sort.

✔ Culling

Particles outside the camera frustum → not rendered.

✔ Count based on device profile

P1: 20,000

P2: 10,000

P3: 5,000

P4: 0 (Lottie)



📱 7. MOBILE FALLBACK STRATEGY

Mobile strategy must be strict and safe.

On Mobile:

✔ Disable complex shaders

✔ Disable galaxy 3D

✔ Disable heavy physics

✔ Replace R3F with lightweight Lottie / WebM

✔ Scroll-trigger animations only

✔ Soft gradients instead of nebula

✔ 2D aura instead of 3D energy waves

Mobile gets:

Vibrations (haptic feedback)

Micro animations

Smooth transitions

Motion-safe scroll revealing

Reduced audio bitrates

But no heavy GPU load.



🖼 8. FALLBACK ASSET PIPELINE

We generate:

Lottie animations

Aurora

Nebula

Chakra ring

Particle sweep

WebM looping video

Galaxy background

Particle field

Mandala rotation

Energy wave flow

Static fallback (super lite)

PNG galaxy

Gradient backgrounds

Cursor will generate all variants.



🌀 9. STREAMING & PROGRESSIVE LOADING

We use:

✔ Progressive loading

Load lighter layers first → heavy layers later.

✔ Scene chunk loading

Split 3D worlds into:

Base

Mid

High

Loaded sequentially.

✔ Invisible loading

Optimizing user experience:

"Galaxy awakening…"

"Loading cosmic textures…"



🛠 10. COMPONENT-LEVEL PERFORMANCE RULES

All UI components use:

Motion-safe animations

Low CPU opacity transitions

GPU-friendly transforms (translate3D)

Framer Motion layout transitions

Reduced re-renders

Cursor follows these rules while coding.



🔧 11. SERVER-SIDE PERFORMANCE

Next.js optimizations:

Route-level code splitting

Edge caching

Static generation (where possible)

Image optimization

Preloading key fonts

Minifying shaders



🧪 12. PERFORMANCE TEST SUITE

We include automated tests:

Desktop tests

Average FPS > 55

GPU memory < 800MB

Shader load < 10 ms

Scene init < 150 ms

Mobile tests

FPS > 28

No overheating above threshold

Interaction latency < 100 ms

Cursor can run Lighthouse, WebTest, and Smoke Tests.



🔮 SECTION 12 COMPLETE

Your cosmic website now has:

✔ Device-aware rendering

✔ Adaptive 3D fallback

✔ Lottie/WebM backups

✔ Low-CPU animations

✔ GPU-optimized shaders

✔ Efficient particle rendering

✔ Progressive loading

✔ Mobile-first safety

✔ Full performance test suite

This ensures that every person — from iPhone 6 to M2 Ultra Mac — can experience Jyoti.app smoothly.

## 🌙 PHASE 2 — SECTION 13

ACCESSIBILITY & MOTION SAFETY LAYER v1.0

(Ensuring Jyoti.app is usable, comfortable, safe, and inclusive for all users — including sensitive users, low-vision users, disabled users, and motion-sensitive users.)

This is not optional.

If we run heavy animations, shaders, sound, parallax and glowing effects → we MUST build a safety system.

This system ensures your cosmic website is:

✨ Beautiful

✨ Magical

✨ Smooth

✨ AND physically comfortable

No dizziness.

No nausea.

No sudden flashes.

No motion-triggered discomfort.



🌸 1. Why This Layer Matters

Astrology audiences include:

People with epilepsy risk

People with vertigo

People who get motion sickness

Older users

People using low-end mobile devices

People who browse with screen readers

People with cognitive sensitivities

People who browse at night

People who prefer low motion

So this layer protects them.

It also makes jyoti.app World-Class, WCAG 2.2 Compliant.



🌕 2. The Three-Layer Accessibility Architecture

We implement accessibility on three layers:

🔹 Layer A — Browser/System Preferences Detection

We auto-detect if user prefers:

Reduced motion

Dark mode

High contrast

Reduced transparency

Larger text settings

Whatever is detected → we respect it.

🔹 Layer B — User Controls (In-Website Controls)

We provide a floating accessibility panel:

⚙️ Accessibility & Comfort

[ ] Reduce Motion  

[ ] Reduce Particles  

[ ] Disable Shaders  

[ ] Disable Sound  

[ ] High Contrast Mode  

[ ] Larger Text  



🔹 Layer C — Hard Constraints

Some motion effects automatically reduce on:

Mobile

Low GPU

Battery Saver Mode

CPU throttling detected

Tab not focused

This prevents heat and crashes.



🌈 3. Motion Safety Implementation

These features often cause discomfort if not handled correctly:

❌ High-risk motion elements

Parallax scroll

3D orbiting

Infinite spinning objects

Camera movement in Three.js

Zoom-in/zoom-out sequences

Rapid shader oscillations

Flashing highlights

Fast cursor trails

We apply rules.



⭐ 4. Motion Rule Set for Jyoti.app (Important)

✔ RULE 1 — No camera shaking

Your 3D scenes will not shake or wobble.

✔ RULE 2 — Safe camera transitions

Camera motions must be:

slow

smooth

constant speed

predictable

✔ RULE 3 — Never animate background AND foreground at same time

Unless strength < 10%.

✔ RULE 4 — Blur animations disabled for sensitive mode

Blur transitions can cause nausea → disabled.

✔ RULE 5 — Parallax capped

Max parallax = 8px movement.

✔ RULE 6 — No flash pulses

Flash/rapid flicker banned.

✔ RULE 7 — Cursor trails slow mode

Particle tail shorten + speed reduced when user selects "Low Motion Mode".

✔ RULE 8 — Chakra waves slow mode

Wave oscillation frequency reduced from "1.2" → "0.4".

✔ RULE 9 — Animations paused on:

low battery

heavy multitasking

CPU throttling

high thermal temperature

(and resume automatically)

✔ RULE 10 — Smooth fade transitions only

No flip animation

No zoom

No rotation

No "snapping" animation

Only:

opacity

translateY

crossfade

subtle scale (1.00 → 1.03 max)



💬 5. Visual Accessibility Rules

❇ Color Contrast

Your cosmic palette must obey:

WCAG AA contrast minimum 4.5:1 for text

We preserve your brand but tweak brightness dynamically.

❇ Text Scaling

## 🌌 PHASE 3 — SECTION 6

⭐ INTERACTION SPECS (Master Interaction Blueprint)

This section defines EVERY interaction in your entire platform — all hover states, micro-interactions, motion rules, touch behaviors, and transition logic.

This is the holy blueprint Cursor will use to generate interaction code using:

Framer Motion

GSAP

React Spring (optional)

Three.js motion

R3F gestures

WebGL shader-driven motion

Web Audio sync

This is where the app goes from "beautiful" → alive.

Let's begin.



🟣 SECTION 6.1 — Universal Motion Principles

These interaction rules apply to every element across website + app.

🌬 1. Timing Curve System

Define a unified motion curve system:

Name

Purpose

Curve

ease-spirit

soft fade-ins

cubic-bezier(0.17, 0.55, 0.55, 1)

ease-energy

chakra pulse effects

cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.1, 1)

ease-astro

cosmic motion

cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.6, 0.3, 0.9)

ease-orbit

planetary orbit

linear



🕒 2. Animation Durations

Micro hover → 120ms

Button/card hover → 180ms

Page transition → 0.6–0.9s

Background world shift → 1.2–2s

Particle reactions → <90ms

🧿 3. Physics Parameters

Used for R3F + React Spring:

Mass: 1.2

Tension: 190

Friction: 26

Precision: 0.01



🔮 SECTION 6.2 — Hover Interaction Specs

These apply to all buttons, cards, links, controls.

⭐ Buttons (Primary)

On Hover:

Scale → 1.03

Glow → cosmic faint gold

Lift by 3px

Text neon highlight only on edges (subtle)

On Tap:

Scale → 0.96

Particle burst (5 particles, ~700ms fade)

⭐ Cards

On Hover:

Scale: 1.02

Soft glass shine passes diagonally

Subtle star particles float upward

Drop shadow increases 15%

On Tap:

Compress to 0.97

Shine retracts instantly

Trigger click sound (low tone)



🌀 SECTION 6.3 — Cursor Interaction Specs

✨ Default Cursor

Custom circular cursor:

Outer ring: 32px, fading, mystic blue

Inner dot: 6px, gold

🔥 Hover Cursor (Interactive Element)

Outer ring expands to 56px

Glow color shifts approx to element's dominant color

Inner dot rotates (GSAP spin)

🪬 Cosmic Trail Mode (R3F)

While cursor moves:

Particle trail with lifespan ~300ms

Color varies by section:

Home → purple/blue

Dashboard → gold/white

Reports → navy/blue

🔊 Audio Sync

Motion creates subtle "whoosh" sounds at <5% volume.



🌙 SECTION 6.4 — Page Transition Interaction Specs

Using GSAP + Barba.js.

Enter Page

Fade in nebula layer (~1200ms)

Particle field activates (random seeded pattern)

Page content slides up from 20px offset

Audio crossfade to section theme (0.6s)

Exit Page

Content dissolves (fade + 5% pixelation shader)

Galaxy background rotates slightly

Scene fades to deep navy

Transition overlay → transparent → next page

Special Transition: "Kundalini Rise"

Used for /dashboard → /guru:

Snake-like energy Path animation rises from bottom

Glow trail follows it

Guru avatar manifests using dissolve shader



🔥 SECTION 6.5 — Scroll Interaction Specs

Using GSAP ScrollTrigger + Three.js scene hooks.

⭐ Scroll-triggered Parallax

Layers:

Stars (slow, 3% scroll)

Nebula (8% scroll)

Mandala backplate (12% scroll)

Foreground particles (20% scroll)

⭐ Sections "snap" gently

When user scrolls:

Each section settles at perfect viewport alignment

⭐ Scroll-driven animations

Examples:

Timeline expands dynamically

Content cards float upward as you scroll

Planetary orbits activate when entering viewport



💎 SECTION 6.6 — Micro-Interaction Catalog

1. Text shimmer

## 🌈 PHASE 3 — SECTION 8

ACCESSIBILITY & MOTION SAFETY SPECIFICATIONS

(for Cosmic UI, Animations, Shaders, R3F, GSAP, Audio, Interactions)

This is one of the most important sections because our website is visually intense, animation heavy, and cosmic-themed— so we must ensure:

It doesn't cause discomfort

It supports low-motion users

It passes WCAG guidelines

It remains usable for elderly audiences

It remains readable in high-contrast mode

It works for screen readers

It works even if someone disables WebGL

Let's build the PERFECT Accessibility & Motion Safety system.



🌟 SECTION 8.1 — Global Motion Controls

We add a global user setting:

Motion Mode:

1. Full Cosmic Mode (default)

2. Reduced Motion Mode

3. Static Mode (No animation)



Technical implementation:

localStorage.motionMode

zustand store → motionStore.ts



How Cursor will use this:

GSAP timelines pause when Reduced or Static

R3F particle count auto-reduces

Shaders switch to low-complexity mode

Parallax & scroll triggers disable

Hover effects become minimal

Cursor trails switch to "dot-only" mode



🌟 SECTION 8.2 — Audio Safety

We include:

✔ Toggle switch (Mute/Unmute)

✔ Volume slider (0 → 30% max)

✔ Auto-mute after 45 seconds inactivity

✔ No sudden volume spikes

✔ No chanting words (your requirement)

✔ Only soft hum & pads

We also add:

Fade-in audio (1500ms)

Fade-out audio (1000ms)

Audio engine auto-pauses if:

Low Power Mode ON

Battery < 15%

User sets "Reduced Motion"

System "Reduced Motion" API = true





🌟 SECTION 8.3 — Visual Comfort Rules

For safe visual animation:

❌ No flashing > 3 times per second

❌ No high-contrast strobe

❌ No red-blue rapid contrast

❌ No hyper-fast rotation

❌ No extremely bright white flashes

Allowed:

✔ Slow waves

✔ Smooth pulses

✔ Fade transitions

✔ Soft parallax

✔ Particle drift

✔ Under 60fps stable motion



🌟 SECTION 8.4 — Shader Safety (GLSL)

Shaders must:

Avoid strobing

Avoid flicker

Have max brightness caps

Limit saturation

Never exceed contrast of 4:1 in sudden changes

We define two shader modes:

Mode A — High Detail Shaders

Full nebula noise

Chromatic aberration

Bloom

Particle distortion

Mode B — Low Detail Shaders

Lower resolution samples

No bloom

No aberration

Simplified noise

Motion Mode automatically switches shader modes.



🌟 SECTION 8.5 — Color Accessibility

Jyoti's cosmic palette is deep blues, purples, golds — beautiful but must follow contrast rules.

WCAG standard:

Text contrast ratio = 4.5:1 (normal text)

Large text = 3:1

Icons = 3:1



Implementation:

Auto-adjust gold brightness on dark backgrounds

Avoid pure black (#000)

Avoid pure white (#fff)

Use navy (#0A0F1F) instead of black

Use off-white (#EDEFF8) instead of white

Accessibility helper adjusts colors in real-time if needed.



🌟 SECTION 8.6 — Typography Safety

We follow three rules:

1. Minimum 16px body text

2. Minimum 14px labels

3. Minimum 12px icon captions

We also:

✔ Keep headings readable in dark mode

✔ Avoid extremely thin fonts

✔ Provide a "Readable High Contrast Mode"

✔ Respect system font scaling for accessibility



🌟 SECTION 8.7 — Navigation Safety

Hit targets = 44px minimum

Links have focus rings

Keyboard navigation fully supported

Skip-to-content link added

Tab order:

Nav → Hero CTA → Cards → Features → Footer





🌟 SECTION 8.8 — Screen Reader Compatibility

All interactive elements must have:

aria-label

aria-expanded

aria-selected

aria-disabled

role



R3F scenes must be:

Marked as aria-hidden="true"

Have alternative text provided visually beside scenes where needed

GuruGPT messages:

Should be read as "Guru message"

User messages as "You said"



🌟 SECTION 8.9 — UI/Content Alternatives

For users who choose:

Reduced Motion + High Contrast Mode

We show:

Static cosmic background image

Reduced parallax

No shaders

No cursor trails

Subtle borders instead of glows

Everything still looks beautiful and premium.



🌟 SECTION 8.10 — Elder-Friendly Mode

We add:

Font Size: Normal / Large / Extra Large

High Contrast Toggle

Disable Animations Toggle



UI auto-adjusts:

Bigger buttons

Reduced complexity

Clearer icons

Future mobile app will also respect this.



🌟 SECTION 8.11 — WebGL/WebGPU Fallback

If device does NOT support WebGL / Safari blocks shaders:

We show:

Static cosmic JPEG background

Soft gradient overlay

Simple particle system (Canvas)

No error messages shown to user

This keeps the brand experience consistent.



🌟 SECTION 8.12 — System-Level Accessibility API Integration

We listen for:

✔ Prefers Reduced Motion

window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)")



✔ Prefers High Contrast

window.matchMedia("(prefers-contrast: more)")



✔ Dark/Light System Theme

window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")



UI adapts instantly.



🌟 SECTION 8.13 — Motion Health Requirements for Animated Spiritual Content

Astrology & spiritual animations can be intense, so:

No spiral animations faster than 90°/sec

No flashing mantras

No fast-moving circular mandalas

Chakra animations must be slow waveforms

Kundalini waves must follow sine functions (not spikes)

Never animate the user's birth details (privacy comfort)



🌟 SECTION 8.14 — Testing Suite for Motion Safety

During QA we test:

Excess motion risk

Strobing

Brightness spikes

Mobile adaptive shaders

2G/3G network conditions

Underpowered device fallback

Cursor will generate automated test suite for this in Milestone 12.



🌟 SECTION 8.15 — Accessibility Documentation

A full documentation file will be created:

/docs/ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDE.md



Cursor will populate it with:

Motion modes

Color rules

Audio rules

Interaction rules

Accessibility settings

This is required for App Store & Google Play future apps.



🌟 SECTION 8 COMPLETE.

This is one of the strongest Accessibility frameworks ever designed for a cosmic spiritual website.

## 🌈 PHASE 3 — SECTION 9

THEMING & COLOR TOKENS (Cosmic + Spiritual Hybrid Theme v1.0)

This is the OFFICIAL design token system for Cursor + Next.js + Tailwind + Shaders + GSAP.

--ease-drift: cubic-bezier(0.18, 0.72, 0.14, 0.99)



Each easing curve maps to specific use cases:

Soft → UI components

Smooth → cards, modals

Wave → spiritual animations

Anticipate → interactive elements

Drift → cosmic background

Jyoti.app is cosmic, visual, and animated — but accessibility stays non-negotiable.

Our principles:

Inclusive for all

Vision accessible

Motor accessible

Safe for motion-sensitive users

Compatible with assistive tech

Semantic first, visuals second

Every component must be semantically correct

Every animation must degrade gracefully

Predictable interactions

No unexpected movement

No hidden traps or surprises

User-controlled motion

If motion triggers discomfort → user can disable

Audio discretion

Ambient hum must be optional

Volume slider & mute toggle mandatory



🌟 SECTION 13.2 — Required WCAG Standards

Cursor must ensure:

A. Keyboard navigation

TAB → move forward

SHIFT+TAB → move backward

ENTER → activate

SPACE → activate

ESC → close modals, drawers, overlays

ARROWS → navigate lists, menus, sliders, carousels

B. Focus visibility

Minimum focus ring styles:

outline: 3px solid var(--color-focus-ring);

outline-offset: 3px;



Focus ring color:

--color-focus-ring: #8ab4f8 (light sky glow)



In dark mode:

--color-focus-ring: #d0e0ff;



C. Screen reader labels

All components must:

Have ARIA labels

Have role attributes

Remove parallax

Reduce hover effects

Skip page transitions

Keep everything subtle



🌟 SECTION 13.3 — Component State Types

Every UI component must support these 8 states:

Default

🌟 SECTION 14 — COMPLETE

This is the full Design Tokens Master Sheet that powers ALL cosmic UI.

## ⭐ PHASE 3 — SECTION 15

COMPONENT API STANDARDS (Jyoti UI Cosmic V1)

This is the unified API contract for all UI components in the Jyoti.app ecosystem.

Every component:

must follow these rules

must expose the same shape

must integrate with animations, shaders, cosmic layouts

must have predictable naming

must be safe for accessibility

must be compatible with AstroOS in future mobile app

must be PgUp/PgDn safe (no layout jumps)

must be automatable via Cursor



15.1 — Component Naming Standard

Every component file must follow:

ComponentName.tsx (PascalCase)



Every directory:

atoms/

molecules/

organisms/

layouts/

widgets/

pages/

scenes/



Every component root element uses:

<Jyoti.ComponentName />



Purpose:

Makes ALL UI searchable

Prevents name collisions

Works with Cursor's auto-refactor



15.2 — Standard Props Interface (must be inside every component)

Every component must follow the same structure:

export interface JyotiComponentProps {

  /** Theme variant: light | dark | cosmic */

  variant?: 'light' | 'dark' | 'cosmic';



  /** Size variant */

  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl';



  /** Whether the component is in loading state */

  loading?: boolean;



  /** Whether the component is disabled */

  disabled?: boolean;



  /** Optional animation override */

  motion?: MotionConfig;



  /** Optional shader override (for cosmic components) */

  shaderProps?: ShaderProps;



  /** Tailwind class overrides */

  className?: string;



  /** Additional props such as children */

  children?: React.ReactNode;

}





15.3 — MotionConfig Contract

(Used by Framer Motion + GSAP)

export interface MotionConfig {

  initial?: object;

  animate?: object;

  exit?: object;

  transition?: {

    duration?: number;

    ease?: string | number[];

    delay?: number;

  };

  hover?: object;

  tap?: object;

}



Always used in:

buttons

cards

modals

cosmic chips

nav bar

cursor trails

scroll animations



15.4 — ShaderProps Contract (R3F + GLSL)

Used for 3D & shader-bound components:

export interface ShaderProps {

  noiseStrength?: number;

  pulseSpeed?: number;

  glowIntensity?: number;

  color?: string;

  distort?: number;

  timeScale?: number;

}



Applies to:

Background nebula

Particle universe

Auroras

Energy waves

3D mandalas



15.5 — Size Tokens Standard

For consistent responsive scaling:

sm → compact (mobile first)

md → default UI

lg → enhanced

xl → cosmic display mode (hero sections)



Cursor will auto-apply padding maps from Design Tokens.



15.6 — Variants Standard

Every component supports:

variant = 'light' | 'dark' | 'cosmic'



Cosmic variant auto-enables:

glow tokens

shader effects

animated borders

vibration pulses



15.7 — Component Lifecycle Rules

Initial Load

Fade-in (150–250ms)

No layout shift

Skeleton placeholder if data-bound

Loading

loading={true} triggers:

glowing pulse

shimmer

disabled interactions

Error

Standard error slot:

<Jyoti.Error message="..." />



Success

Soft green glow pulse (chakra-based).



15.8 — Accessibility & Keyboard API

Every component must support:

tabIndex auto-inherited

Enter for primary button

Space triggers hover→tap states

Escape closes modals

aria-label required

aria-expanded for dropdowns

aria-pressed for toggles

High-contrast override available



15.9 — Animation Pipeline Integration

Every component must expose animation hooks:

useCosmicMotion()

useScrollTrigger()

useGlowPulse()

useParticleDistortion()

useKundaliniWave()

useCursorTrail()



Cursor uses these to generate motion code.



15.10 — Responsive Behavior

Rules for all components:

Mobile-first

Max 3 breakpoints:

sm → mobile

md → tablet

lg → desktop

No jumpy layouts

Scene components (backgrounds) use GPU scaling

Text auto-resizes using clamp()



15.11 — Component Folder Pattern

Example for Button:

/components/atoms/button/

  Button.tsx

  Button.types.ts

  Button.motion.ts

  Button.styles.ts

  Button.stories.tsx

  index.ts





15.12 — Component Story Definition

To support future Storybook integration.

All components must include:

export const Primary = () => <Button variant="cosmic">Click</Button>

export const Loading = () => <Button loading>Loading</Button>

export const Disabled = () => <Button disabled>Disabled</Button>

export const WithIcon = () => <Button icon={<Star />} />





15.13 — Security Rules for Components

No direct HTML injection

No dangerouslySetInnerHTML unless sanitized

No inline event handlers without type guards

All user inputs validated with zod schema



15.14 — State Management Standard

UI components must use:

✔ Local state (React)

✔ Global user state (Zustand)

✔ No component should read Firestore directly

✔ API layer must be separated

✔ No R3F-related components should fetch data



15.15 — Production Constraints

Components must initialize in < 50ms

GPU-bound components < 4% CPU idle usage

Mobile GPU temp must remain safe

Animations capped at 60fps
